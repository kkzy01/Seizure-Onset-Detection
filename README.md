# Precise Seizure Onset Detection of EEG Signals Using Machine Learning Models

Leveraging three models to perform precise onset detection on EEG signals.

1. Baseline model [One-Class Novelty Detection for Seizure Analysis from Intracranial EEG](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v7/gardner06a.html)
2. SPaRCNet [Development of Expert-Level Classification of Seizures and Rhythmic and Periodic Patterns During EEG Interpretation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36878708/)
3. DSOSD

Program instructions:

- Use python>=3.8
- install requirements.txt
- run example.ipynb for three different models
